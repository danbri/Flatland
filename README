Some Octave (aka GNU's Matlab implementation) scripts

Our data is from the subset of archive.org-to-dbpedia associations described at http://danbri.org/words/2011/02/01/658

Usage:

 * Run Octave (OSX: open /Applications/Octave.app)
 * cd /Users/danbri/working/Flatland (or wherever)
 * dosvd [return] at Octave prompt



Basic data (num rows): in data/ ...
	data/programmes.txt  156
	data/concepts.txt 4760
	data/concepts.txt 156


... numeric matrix derrived from movies on archive.org, plus flattened rdf properties.
The programmes.txt and concepts.txt files give labels for rows and columns respectively.

First row of data.txt is numeric IDs (todo: skip these)

cluster_demo.m dosvd.m 

* labels.m - generated by labels.rb from data/programmes.txt

myKmeans.m - one of the several k-means implementations for Octave, found at 
	http://www.christianherta.de/kmeans.html
	see also http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/courses/MachineLearning/exercises/ex9materials/kmeans.m


pdist.m - useful for computing distances (This is GPL, so we should either use it and GPL everything, or tidy it away -- todo)
redo.m - hack to re-run the non-slow bit of dosvd.m

misc documentation: prog_test.png ... failed/somethingwrong viz attempt, output from dosvd.m
